  <p>Golden Frieza (ゴールデンフリーザ Gōruden Furīza) is the Ultimate Evolution[3][7][4] (究極進化 Kyūkyoku Shinka) of the Frieza Race. It was first created and named by Frieza himself. This transformation is achieved by Frieza through vigorous training methods due to his obsessive need for revenge against Goku, as Frieza is a natural prodigy in terms of power, he never trained prior to his endeavor to defeat Goku. Unlike the other forms that are able to be used constantly and are for power-suppression, this form is an acquired, non-permanent transformation used to power up.</p>

  <h1>DRAGON BALL SUPER</h1>
  <h2>Dragon Ball Super (ドラゴンボール超スーパー Doragon Bōru Sūpā) (commonly abbreviated as DBS) is the fourth anime installment in the Dragon Ball franchise, which ran from July 5th, 2015 to March 25th, 2018.[1][2] It is set between Dragon Ball Z episodes 288 and 289 and is the first Dragon Ball television series featuring a new storyline in 18 years since the final episode of Dragon Ball GT in 1997.

        A Dragon Ball Super manga was being produced alongside the anime. The series is developed by Toei, in a similar process to the Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT animes and Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ films. The series plot takes place after the Kid Buu Saga, in between the ten-year gap towards the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament.</h2>

Dragon ball z is my favorite tv show. It's on manga, they fighting. My favorite character is Goku. I like him because of his hair color and when he transformed to super mega sangna. His enemi is Vegeta but sometimes, they work together to keep their islands and to protect the population. One day, Goku and Vegeta got together and become one character to fight BOBOU.</p>
